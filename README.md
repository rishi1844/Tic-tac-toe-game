Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to align three of their marks (either X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before their opponent.

This implementation provides a simple and interactive way to play the game through a user-friendly interface or console.
